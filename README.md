# Nyaasi-Scrapper

### Requirements
* **beautifulsoup**
* **webbrowser**



Gets all the magnet links and titles available for animes in the list.
Then returns the first encounter with desired quality for each anime in the list. i.e. it's now set to 720p so it will return the first 720p video. (quality can be set in the code, its just a string search)
After that it will open the magnet links with webbrowser.

If you are gonna ask why did you make something like this?
I am tired of downloading each anime episode one by one each week, so i start this once a week and it gets the magnet link for the animes in the list and adds them to torrent program. (I use uTorrent). So i just only need to press download and done.
